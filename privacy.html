        <p>
            Where the lawful basis stated above is your consent, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time. You may also object to our processing in certain circumstances where our lawful basis for processing is our legitimate interests. Please see section 7 below for further information on how to exercise these rights. 
            Please note that, where we rely on your consent or our legitimate interests to process your personal data and you withdraw that consent or object to our processing, we may no longer be able to provide certain services to you that are dependent on this processing.

        </p>
        <p>
            If any of your personal data (such as your Contact Data) changes, please ensure that you let us know by editing this in your account settings, so that the information we have about you is kept up to date.
        </p>
        <h2 id="heading3">
            4.	How we store your information
        </h2>
        <p>
            We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent personal information from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorised way. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will retain your information for as long as you have an account on our Website. If you delete your account or request us to do so, we will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements. In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
        </p>
        <h2 id="heading4">
            5.	Cookies
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our Website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Website and also allows us to improve our Website. 

        </p>
        <p>
            For further information on cookies (including about how we use them and when we will request your consent before placing them and how to disable them), please see our <a href="#" class="singleLink">Cookie Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="heading5">6.	International transfers of your information</h2>
        <p>
            This Website’s online store is powered through Shopify, an e-commerce platform operated by Shopify’s Irish entity, Shopify International Ltd (“<b>Shopify Ireland</b>”), which is based in the Republic of Ireland. We are permitted to transfer your personal data that we collect about you from the United Kingdom to Shopify Ireland under the United Kingdom’s own General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Shopify Ireland processes your Identity Data, Contact Data, Transaction Data, Technical Data, and Usage Data. Some of this personal information is transferred by Shopify Ireland to its Canadian parent entity, Shopify Inc (“<b>Shopify Canada</b>”). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Because Shopify Canada is subject to Canada’s own Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), this transfer of personal data from Shopify Ireland to Shopify Canada is compliant with Shopify Ireland’s obligations under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR). This means that any transfer of your personal data outside of the UK and the European Economic Area will be subject to measures that are designed to help safeguard your privacy rights and give you remedies in the unlikely event of a misuse of your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shopify Canada uses a combination of data centres and cloud server providers to store this personal data, some of which are located in the United States. Where personal data is transferred from Shopify Canada to third-party service providers in the United States, this is done in accordance with the export requirements of Canadian privacy law via contractual arrangements substantially similar to those between us and Shopify Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
            For further information as to how Shopify complies with applicable data protection legislation, please download its <a href=# class="singleLink">GDPR whitepaper document</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Save as set out above, we will not otherwise transfer your personal data outside of the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area.
            
         </p>
         
        <h2 id="heading6">
            7.	Your rights
        </h2>
        <p>
            Under applicable data protection laws, you have a number of important rights free of charge. In summary, those include rights to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>access to your personal information and to certain other supplementary information that this Privacy Policy is already designed to address; </li>
            <li>require us to correct any mistakes in your information which we hold;</li>
            <li>require the erasure of personal information concerning you in certain situations;</li>
            <li>receive the personal information concerning you which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to a third party in certain situations;</li>
            <li>withdraw your consent (if you have given this to us previously) for us to contact you for direct marketing purposes;</li>
            <li>object to decisions being taken by automated means which produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you;</li>
            <li>object in certain other situations to our continued processing of your personal information; and</li>
            <li>otherwise restrict our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please contact us using the details provided at the beginning of this Privacy Policy, letting us know the information to which your request relates. 
            We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests (in which case we will notify you and keep you updated).
            We hope that we can resolve any query or concern you raise about our use of your information. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority in the United Kingdom for data protection issues, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), whose website is at <a href="http://www.ico.org.uk" class="singleLink">www.ico.org.uk</a>. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to deal directly with your concerns before you approach the ICO, and would be pleased to respond to any such complaints as your first-priority contact.
