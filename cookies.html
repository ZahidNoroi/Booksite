       <h2>Our Website </h2>
        <p>
            This cookie policy only relates to your use of our website at <a href="#" class="singleLink">www.zahidnoroi.com</a> (our “<b>Website</b>”).

        <p>
            The Website may contain links to other websites owned and operated by third parties.

        <h2>What are cookies and what are they used for?</h2>
        <p>
            A cookie is a small text file which is placed onto your device (e.g. computer, smartphone, or other electronic device) when you use the Website.
